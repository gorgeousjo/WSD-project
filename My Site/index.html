<h2>July 19, 1988 - January 28, 2011</h2>
<p>On January 28th, 2011 an amazing son, brother, uncle,
nephew and best friend was taken away from us by another person. Not a day goes by that we do not think about him. Paul had lived in Chelan, Washington the majority of his life, traveling to many places such as Mexico, Hawaii, and any mountain that seemed to have some great snow to play in. He loved to ski, and with his kind and patient spirit, lived to teach the little ones that passion as well. Paul also filled his life with an interest in cars, sports, painting drawing, listening to music, and reading. Paul graduated from Chelan High School in 2006.</p>
