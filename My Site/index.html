 <h2>Obituary</h2>
 <p>On January 28th, 2011 an <strong>amazing</strong> son, brother, uncle, nephew and best friend was taken away from us by another person. Not a day goes by that we do not think about him. Paul had lived in Chelan, Washington the majority of his life, traveling to many places such as Mexico, Hawaii, and any mountain that seemed to have some great snow to play in. He loved to ski, and with his kind and patient spirit, lived to teach the little ones that passion as well. Paul also filled his life with an interest in cars, sports, painting drawing, listening to music, and reading. His drawings turned into amazing tattoos. He was getting ready to join the Army in May of 2011. Paul graduated from Chelan High School in 2006. Paul's wish was to be cremated and have some of his ashes spread in Hawaii because that was his favorite family vacation. On July 16th, 2011 there was a Celebration of Life, where we took some of his ashes up to his favorite spot on the lake in our hometown and dropped a small urn to the bottom. His family and best friends have necklaces that also have his ashes in them. With his moms blessing certain people who have got a memorial tattoo also have his ashes in their ink. On the 1 year anniversary of his passing there will be another Celebration of Life. We will be going up to the ski hill where Paul worked last winter and will be hiking up the mountain to either ski, or tube down the hill with his ashes and let them lay where they belong. Sometime in 2013 the family will be taking the rest of his ashes and spreading them all over Maui, like he wished. Paul was the best friend that anyone could ask for, and his life should not have been taken so suddenly and the way that it happened. He will forever live in our hearts and soul. And when the sun shines bright we all know that it is him shining down on us to keep us going.

 <h2>Quote:</h2>
 <p>"When tomorrow starts without me, & Iâ€™m not there to see your eyes full of tears, showing your love for me. I wish you wouldn't cry so much, the way you did that day. Thinking of the many things we didn't get to say. I know how much you love me, as much as I love you. And each time you think of me, I'm thinking of you too. So when tomorrow starts without me, please try to understand an angel came & called my name, & took me by my hand. It was time for me to take my place, in heaven far above. Leaving everyone behind, especially the ones I love. As I turned & walked away, a tear fell from my eye. Remembering the life I lived & why I had to die. I do not want to go, with having so much to do. And it seemed almost impossible, that I was leaving you. So when tomorrow starts without me, don't think that we're apart. For every time you think of me, just look within your heart."</p>
